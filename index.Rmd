## Reproducibility Crisis

**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.** Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature*'s survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research.
\

The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.

### The Survey

In the survey[^1] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibilty in science. Below is the list order by the most highly rated:

* Better understanding of statistics
* Better mentoring/supervision
* More robust design
* Better teaching
* More within-lab validation
* Incentives for better practice
* Incentives for formal reproduction
* More external-lab validation
* More time for mentoring
* Journals enforcing standards
* More time checking notebooks
